# Schemes

A source in the site file binds a URI scheme to a protocol. With no source, the scheme name is the protocol. Built-in protocols are `file`, `tiled`, `globus`, and `zenodo`.

## file

`file:///absolute/path` and `file://localhost/absolute/path` are local files (RFC 8089). Any other host is rejected. A percent-encoded slash is rejected. The only query is `?recursive`.

REFERENCE applies when the path sits under a readable entry. The asset URI is rewritten onto that entry's server path. ACQUIRE copies the file into the landing area when the path is outside readable storage and landing is configured. `mode="auto"` then references the copy. Origin mode stays `acquire`.

A directory that is not one describable item needs `?recursive`. Hidden names are skipped. Files Tiled cannot describe are skipped and listed on `Plan.notes`.

## tiled

A source supplies `base_uri` and, when the server requires a key, `secret_id`. The URI path is the node path: `lab.tiled://images/scan`.

EXISTING applies when that base is the target server. PROXY applies when the source sets `proxy: true` and the node is an array or a table. The registered node stores the upstream base as its asset and the remote path as a parameter. ACQUIRE writes an array to `.npy` or a table to `.parquet` in the landing area, then references that file. The plan notes that an array acquire reads the whole array.

The target server must register the proxy adapters:

```yaml
application/x-urisolver-tiled-proxy;structure=array: urisolver.tiled_server.proxy:RemoteArrayAdapter
application/x-urisolver-tiled-proxy;structure=table: urisolver.tiled_server.proxy:RemoteTableAdapter
```

The server process holds upstream keys in the mode-0600 file named by `URISOLVER_PROXY_CREDENTIALS`. `urisolver proxy credentials` writes that file. Workers use the site `secret_id` only while registering and do not receive the key on read. A missing entry is anonymous. A shape, dtype, or column change fails the read.

## globus

A source supplies `collection` and `secret_id`. The URI path is absolute on that collection: `lab.globus:/data/sample.csv`. The only query is `?recursive`. A directory without it is rejected.

ACQUIRE transfers onto `landing.globus`, using a temp sibling and checksum verification, then renames the local file into the landing layout. `landing.local` and `landing.globus` must be the same storage. A successful task that does not appear locally raises `SiteConfigError`. A timeout cancels the task. Secret values named by the source are removed from errors.

## zenodo

`zenodo:/records/<id>/<filename>` downloads that file from the record. `https://zenodo.org/records/<id>/<filename>` does the same only when a source sets `protocol: zenodo` and `host: zenodo.org`. No other `https` host is accepted, and the `https` scheme is not a built-in protocol.

ACQUIRE checks the record's size and md5. A mismatch raises `AcquireError` and leaves no file. The download refuses a redirect onto another host.
